<h3 class="research-title">Summary</h3>
<p>
Sign language is a method of communication primarily used by the hearing impaired and mute community. 
In this method, a letter is expressed by hand gestures. 
Meaningful words can be constructed by signaling multiple letters in a sequence. 
This is known as fingerspelling.
For a non-sign-language speaker, it is difficult to communicate with someone well-versed in sign language 
without assistance from professional interpreters. 
Therefore, it is worthwhile to develop a system which allows a 
non-sign-language speaker to understand the fingerspelling of a sign language.
</p>

<p>
In this work a system has been developed to detect fingerspelling in American Sign Language
(ASL) and Bengali Sign Language (BdSL) using data gloves. A data glove is just a glove which
has a number of sensors attached to it. This study identifies a way to construct a suitable
glove for both the languages. The methodologies employed can be used in resource-constrained
environments. The system is capable of detecting both static and dynamic symbols in the
alphabets. Furthermore this work presents a novel approach to perform continuous assessment
of symbols from a stream of run-time data.
</p>

<h3 class="research-title">Brief Methodology</h3>
<p>
The whole process of sign language recognition using data gloves was divided into a series
of discrete steps. However, it was an iterative process, meaning it was required to perform the steps
multiple times. The first step was to create the glove. To achieve this the preliminary
requirement was to identify the necessary sensors. Once the sensors were identified, their placement
came into consideration. After successful creation of the glove, data collection was
started. Once a significant amount of data was collected, a Machine Learning (ML) model
was trained to classify the data. Details study of the dataset and input from multiple users revealed whether a further
modification was necessary. When modification was required, all or a few of the previous steps were
performed again, depending on the modification. Once a suitable model was trained, sign language modeling, that is,
determining intelligible messages from a stream of sensor data, was started. After successful
construction of a sign language model, it was deployed in production environment. Further
experiments were conducted to find out the accuracy of the model and to gain insight on
comparative studies with other such models. The model was found to give an accuracy of more than 96%.
The following figure shows a flowchart of the methodology.
